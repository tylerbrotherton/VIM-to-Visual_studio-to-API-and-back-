# VIM--Visual_studio--API
This repository gives VIM(classic) access to *most of Visual Studio extensions, add ons', etc and the ability to make API calls from VIM through Visual Studio. I'm aware that this is not intented. I need to use VIM for my disibility and cannot use Visual studio. I'm also aware that this is not perfect code.
